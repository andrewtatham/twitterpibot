[MC Ren as Court Officer]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department;
prosecuting attorney's are: MC Ren, Ice Cube,
and Eazy-motherf*cking-E

[Dr. Dre as The Judge]
Order, order, order
Ice Cube, take the motherf*cking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help your black ass?

[Ice Cube as Witness]
You god damn right!

[Dr. Dre]
Well won't you tell everybody what the f*ck you gotta say?

[Ice Cube]
F*ck the police coming straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
they have the authority to kill a minority
F*ck that shit, cause I ain't the one
for a punk motherf*cker with a badge and a gun
to be beating on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
F*cking with me cause I'm a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
Searching my car, looking for the product
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swoll off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
on ANY motherf*cker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
HUH, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
of cops, dying in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got something to say

[cut and scratched 4x] "F*ck the police"

Example of scene one

[Cop] Pull your god damn ass over right now
[NWA] Aww shit, now what the f*ck you pulling me over for?
[Cop] Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the f*ck up
[NWA] Man, f*ck this shit
[Cop] Aight smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!

[Dr. Dre]
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
to the jury about this f*cked up incident?

[MC Ren]
F*ck the police and Ren said it with authority
because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
and the motherf*cking weapon is kept in
a stash box, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
because it gives em a hint, not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, "F*ck you punk!"
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
with a fake-assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, and I'ma f*ck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
but drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as f*ck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherf*cker that sweats me
or any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherf*cking villain that's mad
With potential, to get bad as f*ck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
[BOOM, BOOM] Yeah, something like that
but it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police, would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a f*ck to say

[cut and scratched 4x] "F*ck the police"

[Cop] [knocking on the door]
[NWA] Yeah man, what you need?
[Cop] Police, open now
[NWA] Aww shit
[Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
[Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em
(Move motherf*cker, move now!)
[NWA] What the f*ck did I do, man what did I do?
[Cop] Just shut the f*ck up
and get your motherf*cking ass on the floor
(You heard the man, shut the f*ck up!)
[NWA] But I didn't do shit
[Cop] Man just shut the f*ck up!

[Dr. Dre]
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Eazy-E]
I'm tired of the motherf*cking jacking
Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and
shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass - or maybe cause I blast
on a stupid-assed nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
of any Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got something stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
by me, or another nigga
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
([MC Ren:] Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
dumb motherf*cker with a gun
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one
that I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say

[cut and scratched 4x] "F*ck the police"

The verdict

[Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck,
white bread, chickenshit motherf*cker
[Cop] But wait, that's a lie! That's a god damn lie!
[Dre] Get him out of here!
[Cop] I want justice!
[Dre] Get him the f*ck out my face!
[Cop] I want justice!
[Dre] Out, RIGHT NOW!
[Cop] F*CK YOU, YOU BLACK MOTHER-F*CKERS!

F*ck the police! [3x]
