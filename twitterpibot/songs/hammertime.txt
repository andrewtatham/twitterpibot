You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

My, my, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, "Oh my Lord,
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet."
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know (You can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (You can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucker (You can't touch this)

Give me a song, or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em now,
They know
You talking about the Hammer you talking about a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know...

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down!

STOP!
HAMMER TIME!

Go with the flow, it is said
If you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump, bump

Yeah... (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in

Break it down!

STOP!
HAMMER TIME!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this 
You can't touch this

Break it down!

STOP!
HAMMER TIME!

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others making records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this 
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this 
You can't touch this
