straight up proven
We can get you groovin'
This track's boomin'
It ain't know hype

Watch us wreck the mic
Watch us wreck the mic
Psyche!

Let's get ready to rumble
Let's get ready to rumble
Get ready get steady and rumble
Everybody rumble

Sit back cracker jack
Don't take no flack
Rhymn in time
To the rhythm of the track
I'm Ant
I'm Declan

A duo
A twosome
So many lyrics
We're frightened to use them
So many lyrics
We'll keep them in stores
We've even got them
Comin' out of our pores
Your Father
Your Mother
Your Sister
Your Brother
Everyone's gotta be an AKA lover

Give us the motivation
We can cause a sensation
Give us the aspiration
We can cause a sensation
Give us girls top speed
Cause the girls stampede
Stylin' smilin' everybody butt-whilin'

Let's get ready to rumble


Let's get ready to rumble
Get ready get steady and rumble
Everybody rumble
Let's get ready to rumble

Partners in crime
We'll never do time
A sentance for us
Has to end in a rhymn
Raw and pure like sushi
Don't try to do me
Use me or even try to sue me

We lay down the law
We're quick on the draw
We played it
We made it
The rest don't score
No jokes No messin'
We teach you a lesson
A state of confusion
To keep you all guessin'

Freackin' it sweatin' it
Bustin' the mic
Slammin' it jammin' it
Do what you like

Let's get ready to rumble
Let's g! ! et ready to rumble
Get ready get steady and rumble
Everybody rumble
Let's get ready to rumble

Freackin' it sweatin' it
Bustin' the mic
Slammin' it jammin' it
Do what you like

(Ready ready)
(Let's get ready ready)
(Let's get ready ready)
(Let's get ready to rumble)

Watch us wreck the mic
Watch us wreck the mic
Psyche!

Let's get ready to rumble
Let's get ready to rumble
Let's get ready to rumble
Get ready get steady and rumble
Everybody rumble
Let's get ready to rumble
