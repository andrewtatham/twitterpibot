Kris Kross is not having anything today
As we stand there totally krossed out
We commence to make you

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya Jump Jump
The Daddy Mac will make ya Jump Jump

Don't try to compare us to another bad little fad
I'm the Mac and I'm bad givin' ya something that you never had
I'll make ya rump rump wiggle and shake your rump
'Cause I'll be kicking the flavor that makes you wanna Jump
How high? Real high
Cause I'm just so fly
A young loveable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside-out its wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pump to keep you jumpin'
R&B - rap and bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'
And ain't something about Kris Kross we all that
So when they ask do they rock say believe that

Jump, jump

A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump

Jump, jump
The Mac Dad will make ya jump, jump

I like my stuff knockin' knockin'
I love it when a girl is like jockin' jockin'
The D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
Yeah you know me
I got you jumpin' an' pumpin' an pump movin' all around
G In the mix I make ya six steps back
They try to step to the Mac then they got jacked
To the back you'll be sportin' the gear that's coincidental
Act like you know it so don't be claiming that it's mental

Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And none faking you can understand every word
As you listen to my cool school melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P

Jump Jump
