Police-a them-a they come and-a they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So they put me in the back of the car at the station
From that point on I reach my destination
Now the destination reached was the East Detention
Where they whipped down my pants and looked up my bottom

Pure black people man that's all I man know
My shoes used to tear up and my toes used to show
Where I'm born is the one Toronto, so

Why would he would he? 

Me sitting round cool with my dibby dibby girl
Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station, black up my hands
Trail me down 'cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What am I gonna do, I'm black and I'm trapped
Smack me in my face, took all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer
