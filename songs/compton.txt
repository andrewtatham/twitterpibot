You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherf*cker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya f*ck with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherf*ckers that's showin out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherf*cker like that
with a gat that's pointed at yo ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
with a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherf*ckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily
yo weekly, monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherf*ckers see clearly
that I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't f*ck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as f*ck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton

(City of Compton, City of Compton)

[Eazy E] Yo Ren
[MC Ren] Whassup?
[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherf*cker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this
But I don't give a f*ck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherf*cker in a minute
I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
a crazy muthaf*cker from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthaf*cker that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself 
every time I pull a AK off the shelf 
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherf*ckin villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
that's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
but a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...

[Chorus:]

(City of Compton, City of Compton)

[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...

...straight outta Compton
is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
and make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherf*cker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a f*ck, that's the problem
I see a motherf*ckin cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin
but don't know where the f*ck he's going, just rollin
lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot? F*ck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever f*ck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
word to the motherf*cker, straight outta Compton
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
(Damn that shit was dope!)
